# Hasheous plugin for ROM Hub

Implements the RPP v1 `metadata` capability: turns a ROM's **hash** into a
game identity, using [hasheous.org](https://hasheous.org) — a free, key-free
public service that matches the signature DATs (No-Intro, Redump, TOSEC, MAME,
WHDLoad, FBNeo, RetroAchievements) to metadata providers.

| Capability | Endpoint | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata` | `hasheous.org/api/v1/Lookup/ByHash/{md5,sha1,sha256,crc}/<hex>` | proposes a name, `hasheous_id`, and any provider ids hasheous has already mapped |

## Install

    rom-hub plugin install ./plugins-dev/hasheous
    rom-hub enrich hasheous 1 --source-id md5:5d7550788a4d1b47ad81fbbbf5c615a9

**No API key.** The lookup endpoints are unauthenticated, and this plugin sends
nothing but a GET.

## Config

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verify_platform` | `bool` | `true` | refuse an answer about a console other than the one RomM has this ROM filed under |
| `allow_crc32` | `bool` | `false` | permit a CRC-32 lookup (see below — 32 bits collide) |
| `set_name` | `bool` | `true` | propose hasheous's game name |
| `raw_metadata` | `bool` | `true` | keep the whole answer in `raw_hasheous_metadata` |
| `cross_provider_ids` | `bool` | `false` | also write `igdb_id` and `ra_id` (see below — these make RomM call a keyed service) |

## Where the hash comes from

Hasheous is keyed by hash and **only** by hash. Its GET surface has four
routes, one per algorithm, and no name search at all. (There *is* a name
search — `hasheous_search_games` on the hosted MCP endpoint — but that is a
`POST /api/v1/Mcp` and `ctx.http` offers `get()` and nothing else. A plugin
has no socket; its one route outward is the host's brokered GET.)

A plugin cannot hash the ROM either: it has no filesystem mount, and `RomRef`
carries a name, a filename, a platform and a size. So the hash is supplied:

    rom-hub enrich hasheous 42 --source-id md5:5d7550788a4d1b47ad81fbbbf5c615a9
    rom-hub enrich hasheous 42 --source-id sha1:274ed5c2ea2ddc855f67d4c4e61c9d9b7eb68403
    rom-hub enrich hasheous 42 --source-id 274ed5c2ea2ddc855f67d4c4e61c9d9b7eb68403

A bare digest is unambiguous: 8, 32, 40 and 64 hex characters are CRC-32, MD5,
SHA-1 and SHA-256 respectively, and no two collide. The plugin also reads
`md5` / `sha1` / `sha256` / `crc` out of `RomRef.extra` if a host ever puts
them there; nothing in RPP v1 obliges one to, so that is a door left open
rather than a dependency.

**A ROM with no hash is refused, never guessed at.** Searching for the title
and taking the top hit would write *a* game's identity rather than *this*
game's, and the library would afterwards say nothing about it.

## Why CRC-32 is off by default

CRC-32 is 32 bits. Across the millions of dumps hasheous indexes, two files
sharing one is an ordinary event, not a theoretical one — and the failure is
silent. Hasheous answers confidently about a different game, and the wrong
title and the wrong provider ids land in your library looking exactly like
right ones.

`allow_crc32 = true` turns it on. Even then the platform cross-check has to
agree, which is what catches the collision: a CRC that matches a Mega Drive
dump for a ROM filed under `gb` is refused, with both consoles named.

## Platforms

`hasheous/platforms.py` maps RomM platform slugs to the console names hasheous
answers with. It is an exact-match lookup with **no fallback**: a slug that is
not in the table raises **"needs mapping"** and names itself.

The check compares against `signature.game.system` first and only falls back to
`platform.name`. That is not arbitrary — `signature.game.system` is set by
hasheous's own signature parser straight from the DAT header
(`NoIntrosParser.cs`: `SystemName = noIntrosObject.Name`, then
`gameObject.System = SystemName`), so it is guaranteed to be in the DAT
vocabulary the table is built from. `platform.name` is a curated database
object that hasheous only seeds from the DAT header when it has to create one
(`HashLookup2.cs`: `Name = discoveredSignature.Game.System`), and an
administrator can rename it.

The table's values are real DAT header names, read from
`libretro/libretro-database` — `metadat/no-intro/` (92 files) and
`metadat/redump/` (22 files) on 2026-07-29, where each file's header `name`
is its filename. Comparison is normalised: everything that is not a letter or
a digit is stripped and the rest lowercased, so TOSEC's `Nintendo Game Boy`
and No-Intro's `Nintendo - Game Boy` agree without this module having to
guess at a second vocabulary.

Arcade (`arcade`, `neogeoaes`, `neogeomvs`), DOS, ScummVM, the 8-bit micros
that only TOSEC carries, and a handful of RomM slugs with no signature source
are **deliberately absent**. A wrong entry here fails silently in both
directions; an absent one says so. Set `verify_platform = false` to skip the
check entirely — that is the supported override, and it is an operator's
decision rather than this plugin's guess.

## What it sets

- **`name`** — hasheous's game name. This is the parsed *title*, not a
  filename: the No-Intro parser splits the DAT entry at the first `(` and
  keeps what is in front, so `Altered Beast (USA, Europe)` is stored as
  `Altered Beast`. Set `set_name = false` to keep your own naming.
- **`hasheous_id`** — the identity object's id.
- **`tgdb_id`** — when hasheous has mapped one.
- **`igdb_id` and `ra_id`** — only with `cross_provider_ids = true`, and only
  for entries hasheous itself marks `Mapped`. A `NotMapped` row is a search
  hasheous has *scheduled*, not an answer it has, and its empty id would look
  identical to a resolved one once written.
- **`raw_hasheous_metadata`** — the whole answer, dropped rather than
  truncated when it exceeds RPP v1's 256 KiB per-field ceiling (`signatures`
  is shed first; it is the bulky part and not where the identity lives).

Everything else is left **absent**, which `MetadataPatch` defines as "leave
RomM alone". A lookup that maps to IGDB but not to TheGamesDB writes `igdb_id`
and does not blank `tgdb_id`.

Hasheous also proxies GiantBomb, Steam, GOG, the Epic Game Store, Wikipedia and
SteamGridDB. RomM's update endpoint has no field for any of those, so those
mappings ride along in the raw blob and nowhere else.

### Why `igdb_id` and `ra_id` are off by default

Because RomM does not *store* those — it **acts** on them. RomM 4.9.2's
`update_rom` re-fetches from the provider whenever a provider id changes
(`backend/endpoints/roms/__init__.py`, the "Fetch metadata from external
sources" block covers flashpoint, launchbox, ra, moby, ss and igdb), and that
fetch needs that provider's key.

Writing `ra_id` to a RomM with no RetroAchievements key does not degrade. It
raises `TypeError: Invalid variable type: value should be str, int or float,
got None` out of `yarl`, when RomM's auth middleware appends a `None` API key
to the query string, and the whole `PUT /api/roms/{id}` answers **500** —
verified against RomM 4.9.2 on 2026-07-29, which is how this default was
chosen rather than guessed.

`hasheous_id` and `tgdb_id` appear in neither the fetch block nor any handler:
RomM stores them and stops. So those two are always written, and the two that
reach out are opt-in. The point of this plugin is that it needs no key; a
default that only works if you hold somebody else's would undo that.

**No artwork.** Hasheous carries logos and screenshots as attributes and
proxies IGDB and TheGamesDB images, but proxied cover art is those providers'
art served through a third party, and this plugin does not put it in your
library under hasheous's name. `libretro-thumbnails` is the artwork plugin.

## Terms and licensing, in plain language

Hasheous is free to use and says so on its own front page: the project's README
states "Is completely free to use", and its MCP documentation says the hosted
endpoint is "intentionally public for free database lookups". The lookup
endpoints take no key and this plugin sends no credential.

What hasheous distributes is **matching data, not ROMs**: hash → name → other
databases' identifiers. There is no game content in an answer, so nothing
here routes around anybody's copyright. The DAT projects it ingests (No-Intro,
Redump, TOSEC, MAME) publish their catalogues openly; the metadata ids it maps
to belong to IGDB, TheGamesDB, RetroAchievements and the rest, and hasheous
holds the keys for those so you do not have to.

`hasheous.org` publishes a `robots.txt` that allows `User-agent: *` and
disallows some named AI crawlers. This plugin is neither: it is a ROM manager
issuing one GET for one file the operator asked about, under the host's own
`rom-hub/…` user agent, and it makes at most one request per hash offered.

This plugin's own code is MIT (see `LICENSE`). It bundles no data.

## Notes

The plugin opens no sockets. `ctx.http` is an RPC back to the Hub, which checks
every URL against this plugin's declared allowlist (`hasheous.org`, and nothing
else) before fetching anything.

The API was derived from the project's own open source rather than by reading
the website: `gaseous-project/hasheous` (the server, and its
`LookupController.cs` and `HashLookup2.cs`), `sargunv/hasheous-cli` (whose
checked-in OpenAPI `schema.d.ts` is the response contract used here), and
`gaseous-project/gaseous-signature-parser` (which is where `game.system` comes
from). The test fixture is built from those published shapes and is labelled as
such in `tests/test_hasheous.py`.

## Seen working

The cover art and titles in this library were written by metadata plugins like this one. Where a tile still shows a placeholder, no art database carried that game — homebrew and interactive fiction mostly are not in one.
